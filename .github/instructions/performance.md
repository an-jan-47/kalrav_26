# Performance & Optimization Rules
- Use Vite’s code-splitting and lazy loading.
- Serve all media through a CDN.
- Use responsive <img> tags or libraries (react-lazy-load-image).
- Convert all images to WebP/AVIF; compress below 200 KB if possible.
- Preload hero assets (fonts, hero bg).
- Defer non-critical JS.
- Minimize re-renders using React.memo, useCallback, useMemo.
- Lazy-load 3D scenes after interaction or idle period.
- Use Framer Motion’s reduced motion option for low-end devices.
- Keep Lighthouse performance above 85 on mobile and desktop.
